#Rainwater Harvesting Forecast Dashboard
Using LSTM & Genetic Algorithms for Water Resource Optimization

#Current Tank Storage
Storage Level: 73%

#Rainfall Forecast (Next 7 Days)
Day 1: 12mm
Day 2: 8mm
Day 3: 0mm
Day 4: 5mm
Day 5: 14mm
Day 6: 3mm
Day 7: 0mm
#Usage Recommendations
Delay garden watering to leverage forecasted rain.
Prioritize tank usage over municipal water for laundry.
Open overflow valves on Day 5 to prevent spill.

#Project Overview
This system forecasts rainwater availability using a machine learning LSTM model trained on historical rainfall, catchment inflow, and usage data. It uses a genetic algorithm to optimize storage and usage schedules. Users can visualize and act on this information via the dashboard.

Green Skills: Climate resilience, water optimization. Tech Stack: Python, Keras, Tableau.
